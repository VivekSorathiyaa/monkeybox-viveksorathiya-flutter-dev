# Monkeybox Flutter Dev

This repository contains the source code for the Monkeybox Flutter Dev practical test. The test evaluates proficiency and efficiency in developing a fitness application focused on workout management using Flutter.

## Test Objectives

The objective of this test is to implement core functionalities of a user-friendly fitness application. The key features to be implemented include:

1. **Workout Management**: Implement basic functionalities to allow users to create, edit, and list simple workout routines. Ensure data persistence locally to avoid loss of user inputs after app closure.

2. **Exercise Selection**: Design a user interface for selecting exercises with an advanced filtering system. Implement robust filtering supporting four specific filters: equipments, mainMuscles, secondaryMuscles, and categories. Allow users to select multiple options within each filter and apply multiple filters simultaneously. Include a 'Clear All Filters' button to reset selected filters and refresh exercise selection.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/VivekSorathiyaa/monkeybox-viveksorathiya-flutter-dev.git
